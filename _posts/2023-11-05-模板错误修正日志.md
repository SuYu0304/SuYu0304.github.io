## 问题：

```markdown
 Liquid Exception: Syntax Error in tag 'highlight' while parsing the following markup: Valid syntax: highlight <lang> [linenos] in /home/runner/work/SuYu0304.github.io/SuYu0304.github.io/_posts/2019-08-08-官方文档中英双译.md
                    ------------------------------------------------
      Jekyll 4.3.2   Please append `--trace` to the `build` command 
                     for any additional information or backtrace. 
                    ------------------------------------------------
```

## 原因：

在目录前面写了注释什么的，导致无法识别

## 改正

将注释放到目录后便就行了

## 原因：

文件中引用的图片和链接并不存在于你的站点中

## 改正

编写的文档里面的图片先放到本地，以后再升级放到腾讯云上
先把官方的四篇文档删掉，只留翻译过的
